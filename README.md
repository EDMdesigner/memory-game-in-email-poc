# memory-game-in-email-poc

We created this css-only memory game as an experiment at one of our company days' hackathons. You can try it out here: https://edmdesigner.github.io/memory-game-in-email-poc/

Supported email clients: https://www.caniemail.com/search/?s=checked

You can achieve support for Gmail if you send it as an AMP email. (You will have to make some changes, for example replace the `img` tags with `amp-img`.)

We are planning to introduce similar interactive functionalities in our [APP](https://chamaileon.io) and [SDK](https://chamaileon.io/sdk).
